## Background
Professor C was approached by a team of researchers from the University of Oxford studying the impact that diet and food consumption has on the environment.  They have published a fascinating research paper on their research (Scarborough et al,2023), however, there is a major limitation with their work.  There is a startling absence of any graphics or visual representations of their research data and findings.  They need your help with this challenge. They have been collecting a massive amount of diet and food consumption data from over 55,000 consumers linked together with food production from 38,000 farms across 119 countries.. 

Each row in the data set from the project contains the following information:
Participant number
Type of Diet
Gender
Age Group
Mean GHG emissions (GreenHouse Gas) measured in kg
Mean Agricultural Land Use in square meters
Mean Water Scarcity
Mean Eutrophication Potential– measured in g of PO4e, gPO4e
Mean GHG from CH4 emissions (Methane) from livestock management measured in kg
Mean GHG from N2O (Nitrous Oxide) emissions associated with fertilizer use
Mean Biodiversity Impact–species extinction per day
Mean Agricultural Water Usage in cubic meters (1 m3 - 1,000 liters)
Mean Acidification Potential

It is a lot of data. In fact, it feels like data chaos.  The researchers would like to know if visualization can be used to gain insight into their data.
